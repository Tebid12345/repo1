Biological Definition: From a biological standpoint, men are characterized by XY chromosomes and the presence of male reproductive anatomy, although intersex variations exist.
Cultural and Social Roles: Different cultures have various expectations and norms regarding masculinity, which can influence behaviors, responsibilities, and roles in society.
Psychological Aspects: Identity and personal experiences play significant roles in how individuals define themselves as men, often shaped by upbringing, environment, and personal beliefs.
