A woman is the weaker sex and most be protected.

A woman is an adult female human being. In biological terms, women typically have two X chromosomes, but variations exist, such as in intersex conditions. Women can give birth and have reproductive systems that include structures such as ovaries and a uterus, although not all women have the ability to conceive.

In addition to biological definitions, the concept of womanhood encompasses social, cultural, and gender identity aspects. Gender identity refers to how individuals perceive themselves and identify, which may or may not align with their biological sex. Thus, a woman is someone who identifies as female, regardless of biological factors.

The roles, rights, and expectations of women vary significantly across different cultures and societies, influenced by historical, social, and economic contexts. Women's experiences and identities are diverse, shaped by factors such as race, ethnicity, sexuality, class, and personal history.A woman is an adult female human being.
